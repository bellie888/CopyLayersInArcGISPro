# CopyLayersInArcGISPro
ArcPy python script to copy layers across maps within an .aprx project
This code is for use within an ESRI .aprx project file.
Specially designed for the GA 250k map sheets production workflow.
It will take the layers from the Standard Sheets map and copy them over to the other main sheets.
The Map Index layer for each map is unique and so is left untouched.

o Copy the code using standard copy/paste method

o In ESRI PRo, open the python window, 

o into the thin text area at the bottom,

o paste the code, the box will expand to hold your code.

o To Execute the script, ensure the cursor is still at the end of the script and

o press Enter on the keyboard twice quickly

o The script will run and the console will indicate what is happening.
